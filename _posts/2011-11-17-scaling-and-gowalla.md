This is an introduction to relational and non-relational databases as they relate to scalability of web apps. The recording is for a guest Lecture I gave at the University of Texas School of Information. 

In this talk I address the storage technologies and tools [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com) uses including [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [Memcached](http://memcached.org/), [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

## **Open Source Libraries**

Gowalla open-sourced a few NoSQL libraries that you can use in your own apps. Check out [Likeable](http://github.com/gowalla/likeable) &  [Chronologic](http://github.com/gowalla/chronologic).
