[Likeable](http://github.com/gowalla/likeable) is a new open-source Ruby library that we built here at Gowalla to power all of the "loves" on stories, comments, highlights and photos that you see. It's built on top of [Redis](http://redis.io/) to be extremely simple, isolated and fast. Likeable plays well with [ActiveRecord](http://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord) objects, but can be used with _any_ Ruby object that implements an `#id` method.

To see it in action, head over to [my Gowalla profile](http://gowalla.com/schneems) and love the first thing you see. Immediately you'll see the heart change colors and the love count increase by one. If you click on that number you'll see everyone who has loved that object.

This might seem trivial at first glance. But consider that _dozens of elements_ on the page must pull this information: how many people have loved it, whether the viewer has loved it, and (on some pages) which of your friends have loved it. Using Redis allows us to stay simple, flexible and fast.

## The Code

Let's say we've got a comment made on a recent Gowalla story.

    @comment = Comment.last
    @comment.like_count  #=> 0

If our user wants to like this comment, he can do so with ease:

    @user = User.find_by_username('schneems')
    @user.like! @comment

And that's it. The comment now reports the details of the like.

    @comment.like_count      #=> 1
    @comment.likes           #=> [#<Likeable::Like ... >]
    @comment.likes.last.user #=> #<User username: "schneems" ...>

## The Install

For Rails apps, Likeable is extremely simple to set up.

First, add Likeable to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'likeable'

Set up your Redis connection in (e.g.) `config/initializers/likeable.rb`:

    Likeable.setup do |likeable|
      likeable.redis = Redis.new
    end

Next, add the `Likeable::UserMethods` module to your `User` model:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Likeable::UserMethods
    end

Finally, add the `Likeable` module to any model you want to be likeable:

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Likeable
    end
