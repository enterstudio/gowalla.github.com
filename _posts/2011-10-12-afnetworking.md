[AFNetworking](https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking) is Gowalla's open-source networking library for iOS and Mac OS X. It's built on top of familiar Foundation network classes, using `NSOperation` for scheduling and concurrency, and blocks for convenience and flexibility.

What follows is an overview of the design principles and guiding ideas behind AFNetworking. After reading this, you should have a solid understanding of how you can integrate it into your project.

## A Solid Foundation

At the core of AFNetworking is [`AFURLConnectionOperation`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFURLConnectionOperation.html), whose sole purpose is to make asynchronous network requests. Each operation manages a single request from start to finish.

    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com"]];
    AFURLConnectionOperation *operation = [[[AFURLConnectionOperation alloc] initWithRequest:request] autorelease];

As the name implies, `AFURLConnectionOperation` communicates over an `NSURLConnection`. Also implied by its name, `AFURLConnectionOperation` is a subclass of `NSOperation`. In combination, we get something that can execute concurrently with other network operations, and--if the need arises--be cancelled at a moment's notice.

Streaming with `AFURLConnection` is as easy as hooking up an `NSInputStream` and / or `NSOutputStream`, and tracking the progress of a file upload or download is just a matter of setting a callback block. Otherwise, you can simply get all of the response data when the operation finishes, with `setCompletionBlock:`.

    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8080/encode"]];
    AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [[[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequest:request] autorelease];
    operation.inputStream = [NSInputStream inputStreamWithFileAtPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"large-image" ofType:@"tiff"]];
    operation.outputStream = [NSOutputStream outputStreamToMemory];

Because of its self-contained, single-purpose design, you could very well stop at `AFURLConnectionOperation` and stick to the bare metal, so to speak. But if your app downloads images, or reads JSON or XML from a web API, AFNetworking has much more to offer.

## Consuming JSON, XML, Images, and Property Lists

One step up from `AFURLConnectionOperation` is [`AFHTTPRequestOperation`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFHTTPRequestOperation.html), which is specifically geared towards communicating over HTTP and HTTPS. `AFHTTPRequestOperation` creates a distinction between successful and unsuccessful requests &mdash; where success and failure are determined by the HTTP status code and whether the MIME type of the response is deemed acceptable.

But what's most significant about `AFHTTPRequestOperation` are the subclasses built on top of it: [`AFJSONRequestOperation`]((http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFJSONRequestOperation.html)), [`AFXMLRequestOperation`]((http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFXMLRequestOperation.html)), [`AFPropertyListRequestOperation`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFPropertyListRequestOperation.html), and [`AFImageRequestOperation`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFImageRequestOperation.html). Each of these subclasses caters to particular types of content, so network operations return JSON objects or images rather than raw `NSData`.

For example, `AFJSONRequestOperation` provides the class method `JSONRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`. The returned operation automatically checks for a JSON MIME type and a status code in the 2XX range; if those check out, it returns a JSON object parsed from the response data in a callback block.

    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/users/mattt.json"]];
    AFJSONRequestOperation *operation = [AFJSONRequestOperation JSONRequestOperationWithRequest:request success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, id JSON) {
        NSLog(@"Name: %@ %@", [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"first_name"], [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"last_name"]);
    } failure:nil];

JSON (`NSJSONSerializer` when available and falling back to [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit)), XML (using `NSXMLParser`, or `NSXMLDocument` on OS X), Plist (deserializing directly into Foundation objects), and images (with `UIImage` or `NSImage`)--AFNetworking includes support for all of these out of the box, so you're ready for pretty much anything the web can throw at you.

## Interacting With Web Services

While we're on the subject of the web, let's talk about a typical iOS or Mac application. If it's doing any networking at all, it's likely acting as a frontend for a particular API, or perhaps even several.

Enter [`AFHTTPClient`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html).

`AFHTTPClient` encapsulates the details of talking to a single API: a base URL, authentication credentials, and HTTP headers. Using this information, `AFHTTPClient` constructs `NSMutableURLRequest` objects that can be used in any manner of `AFHTTPRequestOperation`.

    [[AFGowallaAPIClient sharedClient] getPath:@"/spots/9223" parameters:nil success:^(id response) {
        NSLog(@"Name: %@", [response valueForKeyPath:@"name"]);
        NSLog(@"Address: %@", [response valueForKeyPath:@"address.street_address"]);
    } failure:nil];

### Magic When You Want It…

`AFHTTPClient` can even automatically detect the correct kind of operation to use for a particular request. For example, a request with a `.json` extension would use `AFJSONRequestOperation`, whereas a request with the `Accept` header set to `application/xml` would use `AFXMLRequestOperation`. (See the [`AFHTTPClientOperation` protocol](http://gowalla.github.com/AFNetworking/Protocols/AFHTTPClientOperation.html) for more details.)

### …But Not When You Don't

Magic isn't for everyone all of the time. In the above case, if you wanted to force a particular operation, all you would need to do is override `AFHTTPClient -requestWithMethod:path:parameters:`--and *poof*, like magic… the magic is gone!

## Insanely Fast, On-Demand Image Loading

The final piece of AFNetworking has to do with image loading. You met [`AFImageRequestOperation`](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/Classes/AFImageRequestOperation.html) earlier, along with its `AFHTTPRequestOperation` brethren, but that was only part of the larger picture.

On iOS, AFNetworking adds category methods on `UIImageView` that make asynchronous image loading ridiculously easy. Observe:

    [imageView setImageWithURL:imageURL];

Not only is that easy--it's unbelievably fast. On a decent WiFi connection, table view cell images will load as fast as you scroll!

`AFImageRequestOperation` can even make a 3G or EDGE connection feel downright snappy. Remember that part about being able to cancel an `AFURLConnectionOperation`? This turns out to be especially useful for image loading. As table view cells are recycled, for instance, setting a new image URL will automatically cancel the previous request.

## Go Forth And Network

Thus concludes our whirlwind tour of AFNetworking. We hope you've been emboldened and inspired to give it a try in your own project.

Looking for a place to start? Check out the [README](https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking/blob/master/README.md) for some really useful code samples. AFNetworking also has some [great documentation](http://engineering.gowalla.com/AFNetworking/) (if I don't say so myself)

## Colophon 

AFNetworking was created by [Scott Raymond](http://github.com/sco/) and [Mattt Thompson](http://github.com/mattt/) during the development of [Gowalla for iPhone 4.0](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gowalla/id304510106?mt=8). It's the culmination of months of work by the authors and collaboration with dozens of open-source contributors.

AFNetworking was open-sourced in June of 2011; as of this writing, just 4 months later, it has reached [over 1,000 watchers](https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking/watchers) on GitHub.

If you'd like to contribute to AFNetworking, we would most certainly appreciate the help. [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gowalla/AFNetworking/issues), or if you feel so inclined, create a patch and submit a pull request. Also, if you are fluent in a language other than English, we'd love to make translations of the documentation available.
